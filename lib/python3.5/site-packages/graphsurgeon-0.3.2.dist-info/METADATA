This is a utility to process TensorFlow Graphs for use with TensorRT. It primarily provides functionality to allow users to first search a graph for nodes based on their attributes, and then to perform transormations on those nodes (for example, removal, stitching, forwarding inputs, etc.). Additionally, it includes some basic convenience functions for file I/O.
